    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ripe bananas></li>
            <li>500g low-fat quark</li>
            <li>2 tbsp raw honey</li>
            <li>30g dark raw cacao chocolate (at least 85% cacao)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
            <li>A pinch of sea salt (optional for enhanced flavor)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the bananas:</strong><br>
        Peel the bananas and slice them lengthwise down the middle. Arrange the two banana halves in a bowl or on a plate to form the base of your "split."</li>

        <li><strong>Make the protein "ice cream":</strong><br>
        In a small bowl, mix the low-fat quark with 1 tablespoon of raw honey. If you want a creamier texture, you can gently whip the mixture with a fork or a hand mixer. Add the vanilla extract and a pinch of sea salt, if desired, to enhance the flavor. This will act as your "ice cream" substitute.</li>

        <li><strong>Prepare the chocolate drizzle:</strong><br>
        Break the dark raw cacao chocolate into small pieces and melt it slowly in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) or in short bursts in the microwave. Once melted, stir in the remaining tablespoon of raw honey for sweetness.</li>

        <li><strong>Assemble the Protein Banana Split:</strong><br>
        Spoon the quark mixture generously over the banana halves. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the top, ensuring each portion gets a nice amount of the dark chocolate goodness.</li>

        <li><strong>Optional toppings:</strong><br>
        If you want to add a bit more texture or flavor, you can sprinkle crushed nuts, seeds, or a few extra cacao nibs on top.</li>

        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong><br>
        Your protein-packed, wholesome banana split is ready to enjoy!</li>
