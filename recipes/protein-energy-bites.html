    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ripe banana</li>
        <li>100g rolled oats</li>
        <li>2 tbsp natural peanut butter (or almond butter)</li>
        <li>1 scoop vanilla protein powder (choose a natural one with no added sugars)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp raw honey</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chia seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>A pinch of sea salt (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp dark raw cacao nibs (optional for extra flavor)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mash the banana:</strong> In a medium-sized bowl, mash the ripe banana with a fork until it becomes a smooth puree.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, combine the rolled oats, protein powder, chia seeds, cinnamon, and a pinch of sea salt. Stir well to ensure the dry ingredients are evenly mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Add the peanut butter, raw honey, and the mashed banana to the dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly until everything is well combined. You should have a thick, dough-like consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cacao nibs (optional):</strong> If you want to add some extra crunch and chocolate flavor, fold in the raw cacao nibs.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the energy bites:</strong> Using your hands, roll the mixture into small bite-sized balls (about 1-inch diameter). You should be able to make 8–10 bites, depending on the size.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Place the energy bites in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to firm up.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Once chilled, they’re ready to eat! Store the energy bites in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
    <p>These bites are perfect as a post-workout snack, a mid-day energy boost, or a healthy treat when you're craving something sweet!</p>
